When you view the code in this project, the indentation may appear off. If so, this is probably due to your using a different
font than I do. (I don't like the default Courier, and chose Consolas because it looks better to me while making the
difference between ones and Ls clear, punctuation like periods and commas is easy to see, etc.)

Here's how to make the change:

Window | Preferences | General | Appearance | Colors & Fonts => Basic | Text Font => Change... => Consolas
